To-Do List Web App
Welcome to the To-Do List Web App! This project was developed during my internship at OctaNet Services Pvt Ltd as part of Task 2. It's a dynamic web application designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently.

Features
Add Tasks: Easily add tasks to your to-do list by entering task names and clicking the "Add Task" button.
Task Management: Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from pending ones.
Task Deletion: Remove tasks from the list effortlessly by clicking on the delete icon.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structured the layout of the webpage using semantic HTML5 elements.
CSS: Styled the interface for an appealing and user-friendly design.
JavaScript: Implemented dynamic functionality to add, manage, and delete tasks on the to-do list.
